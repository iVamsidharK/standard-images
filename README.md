# Image Repository

This repository contains a collection of standard images often used in image processing, computer vision, and graphics research. These images are in various formats, such as `.ppm`, `.bmp`, and `.pgm`, and serve as a reference for testing and evaluating different algorithms.

## Images

1. **Boats.ppm**: A popular image used in image processing, featuring boats on water.
2. **airplane.bmp**: A standard BMP image showing an airplane, often used for image compression and transformation tasks.
3. **baboon.ppm**: A widely recognized image in the image processing community, depicting a baboon.
4. **barbara.pgm**: A grayscale version of the Barbara image, often used for image denoising and enhancement.
5. **barbara.ppm**: A colored version of the Barbara image, frequently used in color image processing tasks.
6. **boats.pgm**: The grayscale version of the Boats image, used in various image segmentation and enhancement tasks.
7. **lenna.ppm**: One of the most famous images in the image processing field, depicting a woman named Lenna.
8. **pepper.ppm**: Another standard image used for testing, showing a bowl of peppers.

## Formats

- **PPM (Portable Pixmap)**: A simple, uncompressed image format that stores color images with RGB values. Suitable for lossless image processing tasks.
- **PGM (Portable Graymap)**: Similar to PPM, but stores grayscale images with intensity values ranging from black to white.
- **BMP (Bitmap Image File)**: A widely used raster graphics image file format known for its simplicity and uncompressed nature.

## Usage

These images are widely used in image processing, computer vision, and machine learning research. You can use them for:

- Image compression and decompression algorithms
- Denoising and filtering
- Edge detection and segmentation
- Machine learning and computer vision model testing
